        <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
        
        <p>Although I'm a little familiar with HTML and CSS, I learned quite a bit from the 
            presentation that I missed this past Saturday (Dec 1st).
        </p>

        <p>The first new concept for me was the <strong>CSS box model</strong>, which describes the 
            container-like composition of HTML elements. The image below demonstrates this model (note 
            the boxes comprising the content, padding, border, and margin).
        </p>
        
        <img src="https://sabe.io/classes/css/css-box-model-padding-border-margin/css-box-model.png" height="50%" width="50%">

        <p>It is useful to use more specific tags, when appropriate, as they hold more meaningful
            information. An example of this would be using the header tag instead of simply using a
            div tag. Additionally, it is best to approach CSS section by section rather than tackling
            the entire site at once.
        </p>

        <p>When it comes to defininig the parameters of elements like padding and margin, you always 
            move clockwise (starting from the top): top, right, bottom, left. If you provide a single 
            number, that number will apply to all four sides of the element. If you provide two numbers, 
            the first will apply to the top and bottom, while the second will apply to the left and 
            right sides.
        </p>

        <p>The order of your code is important, as children will inherit information from the parent. 
            Additionally, the latest line of code take precedence over previous lines. Thus, if your 
            code looks like this:
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>div {</p>

        <p>margin: 0;</p>
        
        <p>margin-bottom: 20px;</p>
        
        <p>}</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Then the margin bottom will be 20px instead of 0px.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>

        <p>In CSS, classes are called upon using <strong>.classname</strong>, IDs are called upon using 
            <strong>#IDname</strong>, and elements simply use their name. It is best practice to use 
            dashes to distinguish words in class selectors (e.g. .my-div). This is also known as kabob 
            case. To distinguish words in ID selectors, use camelcase (e.g. #myDiv).
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <h2>Back to the Box Model</h2>

        <h3>Floating</h3>

        <p>Some element srae block elements by default, while others are inline (This can always be 
            overridden using CSS). Floating transforms block elements to inline elements. Floats are 
            necessary for building web layouts.
        </p>

        <p>Sometimes you will need to clear a float so that it does not interfere with your layout. 
            This is done using <strong>clearfix</strong> as a class.
        </p>

        <p>The pseudoelement <em>::after</em> is used to style specific parts of an element. 
            It adds a hidden HTML element after the content of the <strong>.clearfix</strong> element 
            and clears the float. Using an * indicates that the parameters should be applied to everything.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>CSS Positioning</h2>

        <p>The positioning in CSS is <strong>static</strong> by default. This means that the element will stick to the 
            normal page flow. Switching the boxes to <strong>relative</strong> will nudge the boxes in relation 
            to their "original" location (top, left, bottom, or right). If you make the positioning <strong>absolute</strong>, 
            then the boxes will be positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. A <strong>fixed</strong> position 
            will have exact coordinates in the browser window. 
        </p>

        <p>Layering with the <strong>Z-index</strong> allows you to layer elements on top of each other when they 
        are positioned.
        </p>

        <h2>Miscellaneous List of Tidbits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Line-height: makes the line as tall as your text is (similar to line spacing in Word.</li>
            <li>If you specify a value of zero, no units are necessary (As a scientist, I will always specify units)</li>
            <li>Two ways to hide elements include (A) Display:"none" and (B) Visible:"hidden".</li>
            <li>If you deploy a site without using relative file paths, then all of your links will fail!</li>
        </ul>
